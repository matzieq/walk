The baby is sleeping.{pg}When my son was born I felt a weird mixture of horror and exhilaration...{pg}I wanted to cry and laugh at the same time.{pg}And I probably did just that. I think.{pg}It's both such a strong memory and a blur of barely recallable pictures and feelings.{pg}Human mind is a strange contraption.

She looks exhausted, but also relieved that he's sleeping.{pg}Before having my own baby I didn't even notice people with strollers.{pg}Now I look at them and I nod solemnly in understanding.{pg}Sometimes they look back, and I can see in their eyes{pg}that they have only passing memory of sleep.

I love this place. This bench invites you to slow down and be present.{pg}I sit for a while, breathing in the fresh autumn air.{pg}If it weren't for this place, I think I'd have gone crazy a long time ago.{pg}I know I have it good, and that these are first world problems, but sometimes it's just so hard...{pg}Anyway, enough being gloomy, time to go.

I'm not sure whether it's even legal to pitch a tent here. Probably not.{pg}But sometimes I dream of pitching my own tent here and sleeping through the night.{pg}Just curl up in a sleeping bag and sleep, sleep, sleep.{pg}It's the lack of sleep that really gets to you.{pg}First you think that it's not so bad{pg}then you become irritable and permanently groggy{pg}and everything makes you irrationally angry.{pg}You feel you are slowly going insane{pg}and there's semmingly nothing you can do.

This valley is a miracle.{pg}A high traffic road is just up the hill to the east{pg}and the city centre is literally two tram stops away.{pg}Yet, here we are, in a nature preserve in the middle of a pretty big capital city.

I see other children differently now, too.{pg}Funny, how their yelling stopped irritating me, I just smile and move on.{pg}But for your own child it's different.{pg}Sometimes the yelling and whining seems to never stop{pg}and it's maddening, as you WANT to give the baby what it wants{pg}Problem is, the baby itself doesn't know what it wants.{pg}And so you get angry, and start shouting{pg}and then you calm down and feel like the worst human scum.{pg}The little human has no idea what's happening{pg}and so, everyone is miserable.{pg}Sigh...

Our cat is the family therapist.{pg}With just a look she can switch you from the dangerous{pg}"I've had enough" to "okay, let's keep on trudging forward".{pg}"I've had enough" is a thought you start having worryingly often.{pg}It takes effort to snap out of it.

DLG b
I used to bike here with my wife. Now we can't really do it.{pg}Another piece of our life we lost.{pg}She had it much worse than me, there were things I just couldn't help her with{pg}That helplesness is terrible, worse even than the tiredness.{pg}And I really miss the biking...

NAME old man dialog

DLG g
There are a lot of crows here, especially in the autumn.{pg}One day we went here together with my son, and there was this giant tree covered with crows{pg}who were very loudly discussing some issues of importance.{pg}The little guy was so fascinated, he told me to position his stroller so that he could look.{pg}And we stood there for a good while, as he admired the birds.{pg}It was very heartwarming.{pg}So there are rays of sunshine here and there, from time to time.{pg}I grab onto these moments with both hands, and I will never let them go.{pg}They keep me sane.
NAME crow dialog

DLG h
It helps to think about positives.{pg}If there's one thing that having a baby teaches you, it's time management.{pg}You realise that before you had all the time in the world{pg}and that most of it was wasted because of lack of perspective.{pg}You become more conscious of how you spend your time{pg}and where you direct your attention.
NAME sundial dialog

DLG i
One thing I can't wait for is to teach the little guy games and play with him.{pg}It's already amazing to watch him play with his cars and trucks.{pg}He invents stories, gives the cars personalities, and then acts them out.{pg}Another thing I cling to with both hands.{pg}It makes the whole undertaking seem worth it in the long run.
NAME chessboard dialog

DLG j
This is the road home.{pg}My batteries have recharged a little. Enough to get me through the day.{pg}We'll manage.{pg}And we'll become stronger thanks to this experience.{pg}Time to go.
